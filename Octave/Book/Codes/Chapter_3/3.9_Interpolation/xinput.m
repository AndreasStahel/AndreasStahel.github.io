## xinput: ginput points mouse clicks on the screen
##  
## [x,y]= xinput(axis)
##  x -> x coordinates of the points
##  y -> y coordinates of the points
## 
##  axis -> if specified then the first 2 clicks
##       must be on the appropriate axes. x and y (or just x
##       if only 2 points specified ) will then be normalised.
## 
## for example: x=xinput([1 10]) 
##    the first two clicks should correspond to x=1 and x=10 
##    subsequent clicks will then be normalized to graph units.  
## 
## for example: [x,y]=xinput; 
##    gives x and y in screen pixel units (upper left = 0,0 ) 
## 
## select points with button #1. Buttons #2 and #3 quit.
##
## NOTE: xinput just calls the DLD function grab. It is just
##       provided for compatibility

##    Laurent Mazet re-wrote it as grab - so now ginput.m just
